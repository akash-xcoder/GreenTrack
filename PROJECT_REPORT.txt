   - Solar radiation factor (±15%)
   - Air quality factor (±25%)
   - Cloud cover factor (±8%)
   - Random variation (±3%)
   - Final rounded value

2. Solar Potential Calculation:
   - Input: Average daily radiation (W/m²)
   - Conversion: W/m² to kWh per day per 1kW
   - Efficiency: 15% panel efficiency assumed
   - Formula: (radiation * 24 * 0.15) / 1000
   - Annual: Daily value * 365
   - Rooftop estimate: Based on 100 m² roof = 10 kW capacity
   - Cost savings: kWh * ₹6 per kWh

3. Wind Potential Assessment:
   - Wind Speed > 6 m/s: Excellent (commercial wind farms)
   - Wind Speed 5-6 m/s: Good (small turbines)
   - Wind Speed 4-5 m/s: Moderate (small scale possible)
   - Wind Speed 3-4 m/s: Low (not recommended)
   - Wind Speed < 3 m/s: Not suitable

4. Carbon Footprint Calculator:
   - Input: Monthly kWh consumption
   - Formula: kWh * carbon intensity / 1000 = kg CO₂
   - CO₂ equivalent: CO₂ * 1.1 (includes other greenhouse gases)
   - Tree offset: CO₂ / 21 kg per tree per year
   - Comparison with national average
   - Annual projection: Monthly * 12

5. Real-time Generation Simulation:
   - Solar: Peak during daytime (sine wave 6 AM - 6 PM)
   - Wind: Variable with random multiplier
   - Hydro: Constant 60% of capacity
   - Biomass: Constant 75% of capacity
   - Grid load: 150-200 GW simulated
